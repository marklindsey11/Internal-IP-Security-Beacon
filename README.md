Installing a listening beacon on your own ports can provide several benefits:

Detecting and mitigating attacks: 

   A listening beacon acts as a sensor that detects any incoming traffic on your ports. If there is any suspicious or unauthorized activity, the beacon triggers an alert that  prompts you to take action to mitigate the threat.

Monitoring network performance:

   By monitoring the traffic on your ports, you gain insights into how your network is performing. This helps you identify potential bottlenecks or other issues that might be impacting network performance.

Troubleshooting network issues: 

    When network issue's arise, having a listening beacon in place will help you diagnose the problem more quickly. By analyzing the traffic on your ports, you can identify the source of the issue and take steps to resolve it.

Compliance and auditing: 

    In some cases, organizations are required to monitor and record all traffic on their networks. A listening beacon provides a way to meet these compliance requirements and maintain an audit trail of all network activity.

    Overall, installing a listening beacon on your own ports can provide greater visibility and control over your network, which can help you better protect your systems and data.


    The output from a listening beacon is ported to alert an app on a smart phone. 

Push notifications: 

    The listening beacon can send push notifications to a mobile app when it detects any suspicious or unauthorized activity on the network. The app is configured to display the notification to the user and provide additional information about the event.

SMS and email alerts: 

       The listening beacon is configured to send SMS and email alerts to a designated phone number or email address. The recipient then take appropriate action based on the information provided in the alert.

Mobile device management (MDM) integration: 

    The script uses MDM software to manage and monitor mobile devices. The listening beacon is integrated with the MDM software, which can push alerts to the appropriate mobile devices.

    Overall, the approach taken depends on the specific needs and requirements of the system, as well as the available resources and expertise of the organization implementing the solution.
